Webapp built with HTML, CSS, and JS using the Open Food Facts API to check food ingredients and status. Enter a barcode and, if the food is in the Open Food Facts database, you will be presented with an image and a list of ingredients in a table. The table will also indicate if particular ingredients are suitable or not for your diet.
